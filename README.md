# Terrarium

I have built the terrarium using sand as substrate, moss as a primary vegetation, a branch to give space to the spider to climb, glued pine trunks in the back wall to have space for web building. I included a grass as vegetation and a 3D printed swimming pool as a water source. Due to the greenhouse effect, I oppened holes in the side walls for cross-ventilation.
